# Phase 0 Complete - Objectives, Rules, and Reward

## ✅ Phase 0 Objectives Completed

Phase 0 has been successfully completed with all requirements implemented and validated.

### 🎯 1. Fixed Rule Set for v1

**Configuration implemented in `BlackJackSim/config.py`:**

```python
@dataclass
class BlackjackRules:
    # Deck configuration
    num_decks: int = 6
    penetration: float = 0.75  # Deal 75% of shoe before reshuffling
    
    # Dealer rules
    dealer_rule: DealerRule = DealerRule.STANDS_SOFT_17
    peek_rule: PeekRule = PeekRule.PEEK
    
    # Payout rules  
    blackjack_payout: float = 1.5  # 3:2 payout (standard)
    
    # Player options
    double_after_split: bool = True
    max_resplits: int = 3  # Maximum number of times can resplit (4 hands total)
    can_resplit_aces: bool = False
    surrender_type: SurrenderType = SurrenderType.LATE_SURRENDER
    
    # Action availability
    can_double_any_two: bool = True  # Can double on any first two cards
    can_hit_split_aces: bool = False  # Split aces receive only one card
```

**Key rule decisions for v1:**
- **6 decks** with **75% penetration**
- **Dealer stands on soft 17** (not hits)
- **3:2 blackjack payout** (1.5x)
- **US-style peek** for dealer blackjack
- **Late surrender** allowed
- **Double after split** allowed
- **Max 3 resplits** (4 hands total)
- **No resplitting aces**

### 🎯 2. Expected Value Per Round Optimization

**Reward mapping implemented:**
- WIN: +1.0 unit
- LOST: -1.0 unit  
- BLACKJACK: +1.5 units (3:2 payout)
- DOUBLEWIN: +2.0 units
- DOUBLELOSS: -2.0 units
- PUSH: 0.0 units
- SURRENDER: -0.5 units

**Validation:** ✅ All reward values tested and confirmed correct

### 🎯 3. Legal Action Masks

**5-action space implemented:**
- 0: STAY
- 1: HIT  
- 2: DOUBLE
- 3: SPLIT
- 4: SURRENDER

**Legal action logic:**
- STAY/HIT: Available when not busted
- DOUBLE: Only on first decision (any two cards)
- SPLIT: Only on pairs, first decision, under resplit limit
- SURRENDER: Only on first decision (late surrender)

**Validation:** ✅ Legal action masks returned in `info['legal_actions']` at every decision

### 🎯 4. Enhanced Features for Phase 1 Compatibility

**Enhanced observation space (7 components):**
1. Player total (0-31)
2. Dealer face card (1-10)
3. Usable ace (0/1) 
4. Is pair (0/1)
5. Number of cards (2-12)
6. Is doubled (0/1)
7. Split count (0-3)

**Complete info dictionary includes:**
- `player_cards`, `dealer_cards`
- `player_total`, `dealer_total`
- `player_is_soft`, `dealer_is_soft`
- `player_blackjack`, `dealer_blackjack`
- `hand_type`, `result`
- `legal_actions` (boolean mask)
- `rules` (complete rule configuration)
- `true_count`, `decks_remaining`

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 1

With Phase 0 complete, the foundation is set for Phase 1:

**✅ Fixed rule set** - Consistent training and evaluation environment  
**✅ Expected value optimization** - Proper reward signal for RL training  
**✅ Legal action masks** - Prevents illegal actions during training  
**✅ Enhanced observation space** - Rich feature vector for state representation  
**✅ Complete info tracking** - All data needed for analysis and debugging  

The environment is now ready for Phase 1 state representation and baseline implementation.
