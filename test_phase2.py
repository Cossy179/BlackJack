Test Phase 2 Implementation

This script validates the Phase 2 objectives:
1. Generate large batch of gameplay using baseline policy
2. Record observations, legal-action masks, and chosen baseline actions  
3. Train supervised classifier with cross-entropy loss on legal actions
4. Reproduce baseline reliably and provide stable RL starting point
